Week 10 - USACO 2012

comparing `p[k] == avg`
** caution when comparing int to floating point -- computer does not do real number, the floating point numbers are always inprecise
** -- It's complicated, *stay away*

`p[k] * n == total` vs `p[k] == total / n`

Algorithm: Backtracking

* Recursive 
```
cache
navigate(root) {
   foreach child
       if child not in cache
          add child in cache
          navigate(child)
}
```

A -> A1 -> A11
        -> A12 -> A121
     A2 ->...
     
* Often called depth-first traversal, vs. width-first traversal (level traversal)
     
* floodfill
   * need remember which point is visited
   * or you will have deadloop     

* We are not going to use recursive method. -- we are going to use backtracking

**The canonical backtracking algorithm**
```
cache.init()
Bag.push_back(root);
while Bag.not_empty()
   p = Bag.pop()  /* you could have arbitary container logic */
   [sometime we need put p back into bag]
   update_statistics
   foreach q in p.adj
       if not in cache  /* have arbitary cache method */
          Bag.push_back(q)
```

What types bag do we have
1. FILO -- vector, stack
2. Random -- Set, map, dictionay
3. FIFO -- list, deque, priority queue
